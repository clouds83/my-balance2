# My Balance - Finance control

__In progress but functional.__

Hosted prototype: https://my-balance-clouds83.vercel.app/reports

This project was based in a course project that I took, but I modified the way the data is presented and the user interface.

At the moment I'm using a fake back-end, with some dummy data just to help the development. But it is possible to create new entries and delete the dummy ones, what is reset after page refresh.

### Built with:
- Angular 15
- Bootstrap CSS
- PrimeNG UI components
